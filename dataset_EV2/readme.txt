Each network presents correlations among features within one group of subjects. Networks were generated from the input data so as to include features with at least 0.4 Pearson correlation at an unadjusted p-value of 0.05 or better. Edge colors were linearly mapped from -1 (orange) to 0 (white) to 1 (blue) and
line styles set according to three different p-value thresholds (<0.05: thin dotted; <0.01: medium
dashed; 0.001: thick solid).
